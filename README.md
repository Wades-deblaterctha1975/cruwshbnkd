Just walked outta Gap and my mind's like a scrambled egg, I swear. It's like if a kaleidoscope of emotions puked all over a melting 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩—time's got no rules in there. Swear that theater was noisier than a parade, I could hardly hear some parts over popcorn crunches and whispers. Back's killing me, these seats were clearly designed by someone who hates spines.

There's this one scene where the dude’s standing in a corridor, looking lost but also found? Like staring into the void but the void's a fluffy marshmallow, you know? And then BAM, the whole thing explodes into colors ovrdose. Seriously, my head is a rainbow parade tangled in a cat's yarn. And let’s not forget how the soundtrack is like if feelings had vocal cords and screamed in melodies.

> I think I nearly forgot to breathe, just constantly trying to piece together this mosaic of madness. Kinda like trying to solve a jigsaw puzzle with a bunch of pieces from different boxes. Someone should’ve warned me, but then again, would it have mattered? 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   if you’re curious—get what I mean. You won't understand squat until you've been through it. Like a rollercoaster on acid. 

Remember that bit when the lady starts talking to what seems like a puddle of emotions? Omg, what even. It’s like whispers from clouds, like your heart speaking in codes. The reflections, mirages, all of that jazz, blending into one—a symphony of chaos in whispers and shouts. Can’t even tell if two scenes actually follow each other or if my brain created a bridge like some dreamworld architect.

Anyway, just got a flash of someone saying 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   and boooy, you'll be scratching your head like there’s an itchy thought you can’t quite reach. Oh man, still digesting it all, and right now my brain’s a transmission that's slipping gears, making all kinds of clunky sounds.

POP! went the plot somehow. Like a balloon of colors? Dang I’m talking bubbles and shiny fragments. Note of caution, though: you can't just get away 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 it once. It demands a re𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩, kinda like when you’re rereading a novel cuz you missed the whole point. Boy, post-viewing state-of-mind parallels tweaking old-school televisions for that one ‘single’ frequency. Adjust, adjust… static. 

Here's to my discombobulated recollections. Ugh, really gotta sit straight.

Python? Oh yeah. Here's a random thing that won’t work:
```python
def sense_overload(ideas):
    while brain == mashed:
        ideas.append(more confusion)
    return wait, what?

confusion = sense_overload([understanding, plot, colors])  # ?????
```
